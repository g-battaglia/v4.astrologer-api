The most commonly used ayanamshas are `FAGAN_BRADLEY` and `LAHIRI`.

Example API request:

```json
{
    "subject": {
        "year": 1980,
        "month": 12,
        "day": 12,
        "hour": 12,
        "minute": 12,
        "longitude": 0,
        "latitude": 51.4825766,
        "city": "London",
        "nation": "GB",
        "timezone": "Europe/London",
        "name": "John Doe",
        "zodiac_type": "Sidereal",
        "sidereal_mode": "FAGAN_BRADLEY"
    }
}
```

### House Systems

The `HouseSystem` parameter defines the method used to divide the celestial sphere into twelve houses. Here are the available options:

- **A**: Equal
- **B**: Alcabitius
- **C**: Campanus
- **D**: Equal (MC)
- **F**: Carter poli-equ.
- **H**: Horizon/Azimut
- **I**: Sunshine
- **i**: Sunshine/Alt.
- **K**: Koch
- **L**: Pullen SD
- **M**: Morinus
- **N**: Equal/1=Aries
- **O**: Porphyry
- **P**: Placidus
- **Q**: Pullen SR
- **R**: Regiomontanus
- **S**: Sripati
- **T**: Polich/Page
- **U**: Krusinski-Pisa-Goelzer
- **V**: Equal/Vehlow
- **W**: Equal/Whole Sign
- **X**: Axial rotation system/Meridian houses
- **Y**: APC houses

Usually, the standard house system used is Placidus (P).

Example API request:

```json
{
    "subject": {
        "year": 1980,
        "month": 12,
        "day": 12,
        "hour": 12,
        "minute": 12,
        "longitude": 0,
        "latitude": 51.4825766,
        "city": "London",
        "nation": "GB",
        "timezone": "Europe/London",
        "name": "John Doe",
        "zodiac_type": "Tropic",
        "house_system": "A"
    }
}
```

This allows you to specify the desired house system for calculating and displaying the positions of celestial bodies.

### Perspective Types

The PerspectiveType defines the viewpoint from which the positions of celestial bodies are calculated. Here are the available options:

- "Apparent Geocentric": Earth-centered and shows the apparent positions of celestial bodies as seen from Earth. This is the most commonly used and the default perspective.
- "Heliocentric": Sun-centered.
- "Topocentric": This perspective is based on the observer's specific location on the Earth's surface.
- "True Geocentric": This perspective is also Earth-centered but shows the true positions of celestial bodies without the apparent shifts caused by Earth's atmosphere.
  
Usually, the standard perspective used is "Apparent Geocentric".

Example usage in an API request:

```json
{
    "subject": {
        "year": 1980,
        "month": 12,
        "day": 12,
        "hour": 12,
        "minute": 12,
        "longitude": 0,
        "latitude": 51.4825766,
        "city": "London",
        "nation": "GB",
        "timezone": "Europe/London",
        "name": "John Doe",
        "zodiac_type": "Tropic",
        "perspective": "Heliocentric"
    }
}
```

This allows you to specify the desired perspective for calculating and displaying the positions of celestial bodies.

### Wheel Only Charts

To generate charts that contain only the zodiac wheel without any textual information, you can use the `wheel_only` option in your API call. When this option is set to `True`, only the zodiac wheel will be returned.

Example API request:

```json
{
    "subject": {
        "year": 1980,
        "month": 12,
        "day": 12,
        "hour": 12,
        "minute": 12,
        "longitude": 0,
        "latitude": 51.4825766,
        "city": "London",
        "nation": "GB",
        "timezone": "Europe/London",
        "name": "John Doe",
        "zodiac_type": "Tropic"
    },
    "wheel_only": true
}
```

This can be useful for creating clean and simple visual representations of the zodiac without any additional clutter.
